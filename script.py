YOU last remembered the warmth of the blood flowing out of your chest and started to feel the drop in your body temperature. YOU eyesight blurred until it was complete darkness.In that void, YOU asked yourself when and why  it had gone wrong.The person YOU once loved turned her back against YOU. Love is now pure hatred. YOU want to avenge. YOU want answers.But YOU are dead. Acceptance is the only thing YOU can do.

You entered the Kitchen. This place, once bustling with life and warmth, was now cold and eerie. The smell of decay lingered in the air, and the remnants of meals long forgotten were scattered across the floor. You noticed a figure huddled in the corner—an old cook, once loyal to the princess, now reduced to madness. He spoke of her corruption, how she starved the people while feasting in secret. His words only fueled your resolve.

Eventually, you found yourself at the entrance to the Hall, a grand chamber filled with echoes of the past. The Hall was once a place of celebration, now empty and cold, with tattered banners hanging from the walls. In the center stood a figure cloaked in shadow—the old sorcerer who had performed the ritual to bring you back. He greeted you with a knowing smile.

"You seek answers," the sorcerer said, his voice reverberating through the Hall. "The princess has become a danger to us all. Her greed and ambition have no bounds, and you are the key to stopping her. But first, you must pass through the trials ahead."

Next, you moved into the Toilet—a small, dank room that reeked of neglect. The walls were cracked, and the stench of waste filled the air. It was a place of filth, symbolic of the rot that had spread through the kingdom under the princess's rule. Here, you encountered a former servant who had once cared for the royal chambers. She wept as she recounted how the princess had ordered the execution of anyone who questioned her authority. The depth of the princess's cruelty became clearer, and your determination hardened.

Finally, you reached the Bedroom, the heart of the palace. It was a room of opulence, filled with luxurious silks and golden ornaments. But the beauty was marred by a sinister atmosphere. At the center of the room, on a grand bed draped in crimson, sat the princess—Princess S, the one who had betrayed you. Her eyes glinted with malice as she looked at you, her former knight, now a harbinger of justice.

"You’ve come far," she sneered, rising to her feet. "But you are too late. I have everything I need. You are nothing but a relic of the past."
